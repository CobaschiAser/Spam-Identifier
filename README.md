This README presents an overview of the practical assignment where we implemented and compared the Bayes-Naive and K-NN algorithms for message classification(spam or not spam). Additionally, classic and naive methods such as random guessing were compared. The report also includes a variant of Bayes-Naive with preprocessing and results discussed. Each algorithm's behavior was analyzed using Cross-Validation Leave-One-Out.
